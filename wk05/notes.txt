For an unbalanced node t:

1. if the left subtree is heavier, and we inserted to the left of t->left:
	rotate t to the right
2. if the left subtree is heavier, and we inserted to the right of t->left:
	rotate t->left to the left
	rotate t to the right
3. if the right subtree is heavier and we inserted to the right of t->right:
	rotate t to the left
4. if the right subtree is heavier and we inserted to the left of t->right:
	rotate t->right to the right
	rotate t to the left
